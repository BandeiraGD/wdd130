            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Rapids was born during the legendary Splish-Splash Convergence of 1987, a mythical event when rivers
                sang aquatic
                operas and paddles twirled to the rhythm of distant thunder. Founded by a crew of bubbly-water
                enthusiasts and lovers of
                wet adventures, the company quickly stood out for its bold journeys through the frothy currents of Mount
                Wobbleton â€”
                where even the rocks fear slipping. With giggle-powered rafts, jelly-filled life vests, and waterproof
                maps made of pure
                marmalade, The Rapids redefined the meaning of nonsense-driven adventure. Today, it remains the top
                choice for
                thrill-seekers who crave excitement, absurdity, and splashes in equal measure. Its expeditions continue
                to surprise with
                unexpected twists, whimsical challenges, and laughter-filled moments that leave lasting memories.
                Adventurers of all
                ages are drawn to its playful spirit and daring escapades. Every journey promises a blend of thrill,
                fun, and delightful
                unpredictability.</p>
